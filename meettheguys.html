                            <p><img src="image/mn.jpg" alt="the monkees" style="float:right;width:326px;height:235px;">

After The Monkees broke up, Michael continued writing songs successfully and continued his performing career. He had a top 40 hit with the country rock group called 'First National Band'. Michael has been a notable player of the twelve-string guitar who plays custom made electric twelve-string guitars. When Nesmith was 13, his mother invented the typewriter correction fluid later known commercially as Liquid Paper.
                                    Over the next 25 years she built the Liquid Paper Corporation into a multimillion-dollar international company, which she finally sold to Gillette in 1979 for $48 million dollars. She past away a few months later she was 56. Michael went to Dallas public school system in 1949, at the age of 6. Michael said he felt he was as an indifferent student, he participated in choral and drama activities during his years at Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas. This is when he began to write verse poetry. When he was 15 he enrolled in the Dallas Theater Center teen program, where he appeared in several plays. Michael did not graduate from high school, 
                                    he did enlist himself into the US airforce in 1960, where he completed basic training. Michael was trained as an aircraft mechanic. He was discharged under honorable conditions in 1962. He later enrolled himself into a community college called San Antonio College. He met John London there and began a musical collaboration. They ended up winning the first San Antonio College talent award whilst performing a few of michaels original songs and a mix of folk songs. When Michael moved to Los Angeles he began to write more poetry and more songs and began performing in clubs around the city. Nesmith began his recording career in 1963 by releasing a single on the Highness label.
                                    He followed this in 1965 with a one-off single released on Edan Records. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied for the job. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Michael back. Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Michael wrote many songs for The Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary" and "Listen to the Band", became minor hits.
                                    As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the manufactured image of the whole project. He was only permitted to write and produce two songs per album, and his music was frequently featured in episodes of the series. Michael was the most publicly vocal Monkee about the band's prefabricated image. Nesmith did not participate in the Monkees' 20th-anniversary reunion. However, he did appear during an encore with the other three members at the Greek Theatre on September 7, 1986. In a 1987 interview for Nick Rocks, Michael said "When Peter called up and said 'we're going to go out, do you want to go?' I was booked. But, if you get to L.A ... I'll play." </p>
