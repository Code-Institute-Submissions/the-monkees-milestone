                            <h4>The Monkees are an American pop and rock band that were originally active between 1966 and 1971. Over the next few decades they had reunion tours and albums that were followed. The Monkees were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by a couple of guys called Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television show that happened to be called The Monkees which was on TV from 1966 to 1968. The band consisted of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band had their music supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.</h4>

                            <h4>The Monkees were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". This was down to the filming of the television show. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. The television show ended up getting canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.</h4>

                            <h4>During the casting process Screen Gems' head of music, Don Kirshner. He was contacted to secure music for The Monkees. Kirshner assigned Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart to the project. The duo contributed four demo recordings for The Monkees. One of these recordings was the theme for the "The Monkees" which helped get the series the green light.
                                When The Monkees was picked up as a television series, the development of the musical side accelerated. Columbia-Screen Gems and RCA Victor entered into a joint venture called Colgems Records primarily to distribute Monkees records. Raybert was the one who rented musical intruments and rented space for the group to practice performing in April 1966, but it quickly was seen they would not be quite right in time for the television series debut. The producers called upon Kirshner to recruit a producer for the Monkees sessions.
                                Kirshner called on Snuff Garrett, composer of several hits by Gary Lewis & the Playboys, to produce the initial musical cuts for the show. Garrett meet the guys in June 1966 and decided that Jones would sing lead, it was an unpopular choice with the group. This reception led Kirshner to drop Garrett and had to buy out his contract. Kirshner next allowed Nesmith to produce sessions, provided he did not play on any tracks he produced. Nesmith did, however, start using the other Monkees on his sessions, particularly Tork as a guitarist. Kirshner came back to the enthusiastic Boyce and Hart to be the regular producers, but he brought in one of his top East Coast associates, Jack Keller, to lend some production experience to the sessions.
                                Boyce and Hart learned quickly that the four actors would fool around when they were brought into the studio together and try to make each other laugh. Because of this situation they had to bring in each singer indavidually.</h4>
