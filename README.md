The Monkees 1960's Rock band Milestone Project.

This project is about a 1960's rock band called The Monkees, they were formed in 1965. What i'm looking to do in this project is create a wbesite
for the rock band, and give the user who uses this website a background knowledge of each indavidual member of the band and how they started in the 
industry. I will be using a vast ray of different syles to make the website more user friendly and come to life.

I will be making different types of pages, a landing page which is going to be the main page that hosts what the website has to offer, a signup 
function and even social media quotes. A history page that tells the history of The Monkees. A band members page that goes through each member from how
they got into the music industry to a video of one of their greatest songs. And finally a contact page, where people can book the band for private parties.


This is a website not just for fan based clients, but for people who look to find out more information about the band. They can not only find out more info, but
be able to contact them to make a booking so they can play at their venue. 

I've made it very simple for the user to achieve these things. As soon as your arrive at the homepage across the top is a selection of different choices from history 
to contact page. The user can just go and click on whichever page they seem fit and it takes them straight to that page filled with different information. I find it the
best way for users to enjoy their experience is to make it simple and easy to navigate, where they don't get frustrated from the pages not loading properly to taking a while
to look for the right things.

As a user type, i want to perform an action, so that i can achieve a goal. For Example, a user is trying to find out information about a certain member. It is made simple by
the navigation bar at the top. clicking on meet the guys and scroll down and find out the information.

As a user type, i want to perform an action, so that i can achieve a goal. For example , a user is wanting to book the band to play at a users party and to find out more about it,
they can again go to the navigation bar at the top, click on contact and fill out the form and someone will be in touch to arrange the booking and to give more detail about booking 
the band.


The sign up button allows the users to sign up to the webiste to receive updates on the band, they do this by filling out the form, each section of the form has a 
required field so that user has to enter each section before they can click on send. 

The social media features down at the bottom of each and every page on the website links to external websites for example the facebook link takes you to 
facebook media page and so on and it opens a new tab on your device or web browser so you don't lose the page you were currently on.

The contact form feature is where a user can enter the information required and they will contact the user with more information about hiring the band to play at thier 
party or events.

The mobile device feature is made for mobile experience as a lot more people are using mobiles, tablets and other smart devices to view content on the web. I have put a
navigation bar at the top as a drop down menu when in mobile view or tablet view. It is also made easy to select each page as it fits the whole screen in.

Another feature on all the pages i have created is a picture of The Monkees as a static background image where you scroll down and more information is revealed. This 
allows the user to have a better visual experience, whilst remebering The Monkees back in their prime.

A feature i have left to implement is a live calander filled with The Monkees live tours, upcoming events and the days where The Monkees are playing private events they will 
be greyed out and listed as private events. They will be able to click on updates and tours button in the navigation top find out all this information.


Background Position.
https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/
I used this website to position my image of The Monkees and make it a static image so as the user scrolls down there is a picture in the background but have content
over lap it having a constant image in the background.

Boostrap:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/
I used Bootsrap to bring my page to life, i used bootsrap to help me make my contact form and my sign up modal form. Bootsrap is helping me show off a creative side
by putting little pictures on my site to add a better visual experience.


Google Fonts:
https://fonts.google.com/
I used google fonts to change the font of my website so it didn't look like a microsoft word file and make it look like a professional website.

Font Awesome:
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
I used font awesome to bring my Social media pictures at the bottom to look better and make them stand out.

Jquery:
https://code.jquery.com/
I used Jquery to enhance my project to ensure my site works everywhere and anywhere on as much devices as possible.


Signup form:

Go to the "Home" 
Click on sign up button, 
Enter in your first name, click send, it will prompt you that a field is not filled out,
Enter in your second name clikc on send, again it will prompt you that a required field is not entered
Enter your email address in, click send it will send if you enter in your email with "@" being used, if it is not used it will prompt you do so.

Contact form:

Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears,
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
The box size changes from different devices so it would look smaller on a mobile device compare to a web browser on a computer.

Social media buttons:

Go to the bottom of the page
Click on facebook icon,
Check that it opens up to the relevant site and on to another tab so you dont lose the current page you are on.
Click on twitter icon,
Check that it opens twitter webpage up on another tab without closing the current page or losing the current webpage.
All of the social media links have been tested from each web page from history to contact page. It has also been tested on many devices
from mobile phones to tablets and even different web browsers e.g. google chrome, internet explorer, apples internet explorer.

social media section on homepage:

On the "homepage" there is a section where it shows 2 pictures of fans who attended a live show of the band, it shows what they tweeted or facebooked out on
to social media to describe what a wonderful time they had at a live show. On the Web browser it shows the 2 pictures and their comments, but it also showed
on the mobile device and it was cluttering up the web page so i decided once it drops below certain pixels the pictures disapear and only the comments from their
webites are listed. I have has this tested on many mobile devices and tablet.

Navbar mobile view:

On a mobile device click on the navbar,
a drop down menu appears, click on contacts page to take you to the contacts page,
click on the navbar again this time from the drop down menu click on meet the guys page,
this has been tested on multiple devices and tablets e.g. Samsung s9, Iphone xs max, Ipad pro. 
this has also been tested in chrome developer tools so i can shrink the pixels down to activate the navbar at the top.


I backed up each section or page of work on Github.

Firstly i started a project on Github, I entered my repository name which i gave it the-monkees-milestone-project. I put a description in of this
being my first milestone project. I clicked create, then went to my cloud9 project of the monkees. I opened up a new terminal made sure I was on the right
folder by entering "pwd" command. I then used the command "git init", then i used git add to add all the relevant files to be commited. I then typed in the
command line "git status" to check all the files had been added. I then entered in "git commit -m "initial commit" " to commit the changes to my local repository.
Now that I commited I then pushed it to github. I did this by copying and pasting the push an existing repository from a command line, line. I pushed enter and then copy
and pasted the second line to push it " git push -u origin master" I then had to enter my username and password for github. 

Once i finsihed my website and all my commits,
I was ready for deployment which I went to settings under my project and then down to github pages. I then Chose "Master Branch" and click save.

I am Grateful to use this picture.


I recieved my inspiration to do this project on The Monkees by listening to their songs and actually knowing the songs, they are very catchy and put you in a good mood.
i also found the inspiration to do this project as it gave me an oppitunity to go back to an era of music that i don't tend to listen to and gives me and broader experience
of music.
